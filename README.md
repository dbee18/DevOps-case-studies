# DevOps Case Studies

At Praqma we talk a lot about DevOps and Continuous Delivery. We teach this in many contexts and to many different types of people

One of the problems with this is that while there are many concrete practices and implementations of DevOps techniques, what we can cover
in a short course is often high-level abstract or of the _it depends_ flavor.

Therefore we have written these cases studies to use at classes as discussion points.
The cases are not based on any concrete companies, but is rather an amalgamation of experiences.

## How to use these case studies

The cases strive to be an objective description of the properties of a fictional company ACME.
The business model is described as well as team and product.
The cases should not in their descriptions pass too much judgment but they are failing slightly at this.

Each case contains a few suggested perspectives for discussions, but they are not final. For each of the cases it is good
consideration to ask, what if you were hired by ACME, in a fitting role for you. What would your approaches, pains and prouds be?

Remember that these cases are nothing but conversation starters. No case is better or worse than the other, and there are no answer book to this repository.

The cases are not meant to be complete, so fill in the blanks where you need to.

Remember to have fun!

## The Case studies

In [ACME Embedded devices](ACME-embedded-devices.md) we meet a huge corporation in the appliance market.

In [ACME Software Consultants](ACME-software-consultants.md) we see a company developing plugins to a third party platform.

In [ACME Web development](ACME-web-development.md) a web company is providing businesses with their custom CMS.
