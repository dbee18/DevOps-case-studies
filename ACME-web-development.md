# ACME Web Development

ACME is a small and growing web development company. Their primary product is an in-house developed CMS. That they also sell plugins to.
They also take ad-hoc digital development tasks from their customers. These require custom development 

## The Team

They have around five developers, a graphics designer, a salesperson and the founder.
The founder has a non-technical education, but is digital _smart_.

## The Product

The product is an in-house developed CMS called LaZyWeb. It is the backbone of ACMEs business. It has been with the company

A project was started to rebuild LaZyWeb from scratch, but it was scrapped after a lot of effort was put into a one-to-one replacement of LaZyWeb.
They never seemed to become quite close enough to something to release to its customers. And LaZyWeb was battled-tested so they decided to keep working with the old codebase.

When ACME starts a new customer engagement the dev locates the newest version on their shared drive and copies that, renaming it to the new customer name.
Customization and skinning of LaZyWeb happens in the customer specific version. Code is copied between customer folders, when features and fixes needs to be applied to several customer sites. The shared drive is also served by a webserver so developers can test the customer solution in-house.

The local server with the shared drive is exposed to the internet and this allows the customers to view current progress, and accept the release before it is delivered to their production environments.

There are no tests. The founder does manual explorative testing during and after development.

ACME does not use any task management system. Specifications, estimates and progress is written in Excel sheets.

After developers estimate tasks, the founder tries to sell it to the customer. Often developers are bullied into down estimating items.

During development the founder and salesperson often changes the specifications making the developers aim at a moving target.

When a bug is found in a customer site sometimes the same bug needs to be fixed on other customer sites. It can be difficult to figure out what customers has a version of the software deployed with the bug. Priorities can change multiple times a day, as bug fixes or quick development tasks pre-empts the feature development that is going on.

The mixture of custom development and long running engagements lead to many context switches.

The customers are okay with the product they are receiving, but not overly excited.

Customer solutions are hosted on webhotels bought by the customer. ACME has a few requirements such as PHP and MySQL.
Developers FTP the PHP files to the webhotel and creates the necessary databases through whatever interface the hosting provider has.

Often new features are drawn by the designer and agree upon with the customer, then this will be turned over to the developers to actually implement.
This leads to conflict between designer, management and developers, as the designer and management does not have an understanding of that is easy and what is difficult.

## Case Studies

In this section we describe some different roles that could try to influence the way of working at ACME Software Consultants.
For each section discuss how to make problems and solutions visible. As well as a (short) prioritized list of things to do/investigate.

### A new developer joins the team

You are a new developer joining the team, with the knowledge above, what challenges do you foresee you will have as your onboarding starts.
What would your current experience bring to this team. What is the first thing that you would address? Both technical and cultural.

### CTO as a Service

The founder has recognized there is a lot of bookkeeping and overhead in the way they work, so he has hired a _Technical Mentor_.
That is you. What would be your counsel to the Founder? What would be the first three steps?

### Salesperson

You've noticed that what feels like small features take a long time to deliver. It seems that a lot of bugs are not noticed until production.
Releases are unstable and you are getting tired from spending so much time trying to appease angry customers on the phone.
How can we best assist the salesperson in alliviating the pain?
